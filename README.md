## COVID-Portfolio-Project
In this project, I used two datasets containing global data on Covid 19 from 1/1/20 through 4/30/21, specifically related to deaths and vaccinations. I used SQL Server to explore the data and find interesting insights. Some of the skills used during the project include Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. Later, I used these datasets and the insights I found during the project and uploaded them into Tableau to create a dashboard.
